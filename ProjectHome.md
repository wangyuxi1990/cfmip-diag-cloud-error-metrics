The four scalar measures of the fidelity of model cloud simulations are described in Section 4 of Klein et al. (2013).  E\_TCA measures fidelity in simulating total cloud amount.  E\_CP measures fidelity in simulating cloud-top pressure and optical depth in different categories of optically intermediate and thick clouds at high, middle, and low-levels of the atmosphere. The impacts on top-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave radiation in the same categories used for E\_CP are measured by E\_SWCP and E\_LWCP, respectively.  Greater fidelity with respect to ISCCP observations is represented by lower E values.
